## File Structure

- `main.py` - The main command-line interface of the system
- `mainly.py` - The main GUI interface of the system
- `checkin_gui_and_program.py` - Check-in interface and functionality
- `checkoutgui.py` - Check-out interface and functionality
- `listgui.py` - Guest list display interface
- `getinfoui.py` - Guest information retrieval interface
- `recipt.py` - Receipt generation functionality
- `hotel.dat` - Data storage file

## Room Rates (Per Day)

- Deluxe Room: â‚¹2000
- Semi-Deluxe Room: â‚¹1500
- General Room: â‚¹1000

## How to Use

1. Run `mainly.py` to start the hotel management system
2. Use the main menu to access different features:
   - Check-in new guests
   - View guest list
   - Process check-outs
   - Retrieve guest information
   - Exit the system

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)
- Pickle (for data persistence)

## Data Storage

The system uses binary file storage (`hotel.dat`) to maintain guest records using Python's pickle module. This file:

- Is created automatically when the first guest checks in
- Stores data in binary format to ensure data integrity
- Gets updated during check-in (appending new records) and check-out (removing records)
- Is used for all guest-related operations (listing, information retrieval)

Each record in `hotel.dat` contains the following guest information:

- Guest name
- Address
- Mobile number
- Room number
- Total bill

Note: If `hotel.dat` is corrupted or deleted, the system will automatically create a new one, but previous guest records will be lost. It's recommended to regularly backup this file.

## Notes

- The system automatically handles room allocation
- 10% discount is provided on card payments
- Data is persistently stored and retrieved using pickle
- GUI is built using Tkinter for ease of use
